## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6-phase structure derived from requirement categories with dependency chain: Foundation -> Terminal -> Claude -> Versioning -> Change Indicators -> Polish
- [Roadmap]: Phase 3 (Claude Integration) flagged for deeper research during planning -- Claude CLI PTY behavior and auth flow need investigation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Claude CLI's specific TTY behavior, `-p` flag bugs, and interactive sub-process handling need hands-on testing before Phase 3 planning
- [Research]: Multi-terminal WebGL performance (>4-6 panes may exhaust GPU memory) needs testing during Phase 2
